                            <p>Hello, this is FengQM. You can see my curriculum vitae  <a href="about.html">  on this page</a>.</p>
                            <p>This website was founded in the summer of 2021, which is similar to many personal websites. At that time, inspired by other personal websites, I built my own website.</p>
                            <p>In the first three years, the development direction was different from what I expected. It did not become a technology blog. Because in the process of constantly writing content, I gradually feel that it is not as interesting to talk about technology with others as it is to talk about life and ideas with others.</p>
                            <p>I don't like to talk about politics and society. I like different cultures and all kinds of ideas, all kinds of things and things that I haven't seen, heard or idealized. At the same time, go deep into yourself and explore free will. If you and I are willing to share ourselves</p>
                            <p>So before I write the article later, I will think about what I have here and what ideas others haven't mentioned. Whether these contents are useful after writing, whether they are  <strong>  interesting</strong>.At the same time, I also hope that my words can make you feel quiet and slow when reading, even if you may just pass by in a hurry. Slow down, there is only text here, no hurry.</p>
                            <p>This is the update positioning in the last two years. I hope it can make you feel that my website is becoming interesting little by little¡£</p>
                            <p>Then we'll see you later¡£</p>
